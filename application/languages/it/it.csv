"CORE_FORM_ADMIN_SETTINGS_PERFORMANCE_DESCRIPTION";"For very large social networks,
it may be necessary to enable caching to improve performance. If there is a noticable
decrease in performance on your social network, consider enabling caching below
(or upgrading your hardware). Caching takes some load off the database server by
storing commonly retrieved data in temporary files (file-based caching) or memcached
(memory-based caching). If you are not familiar with caching, we do not recommend
that you change any of these settings."
"CORE_FORM_ADMIN_SETTINGS_PERFORMANCE_LIFETIME_DESCRIPTION";"This determines how long
the system will keep cached data before reloading it from the database server. A
shorter cache lifetime causes greater database server CPU usage, however the data
will be more current. We recommend starting off with 60-120 seconds."
"CORE_FORM_ADMIN_SETTINGS_PERFORMANCE_TYPE_DESCRIPTION";"If you have enabled
caching above, please select the type of caching that you want to use. Memcache
caching (if available) will use memory (RAM) which is not as abundant as disk
space, however it will be faster than file-based caching when performing
read/write operations"
"CORE_FORM_ADMIN_SETTINGS_PERFORMANCE_FILE_PATH_DESCRIPTION";"This is where the
temporary files containing the cached data are stored. Folder must be writable
(chmod 777). This should be a path relative to the base directory where
SocialEngine is installed."
"CORE_FORM_ADMIN_SETTINGS_PERFORMANCE_ENABLE_DESCRIPTION";"Enable caching? Enabling
caching will decrease the CPU
usage of your database server (resulting in a decrease of page load
times). While some non-critical data may appear slightly out of date,
this will usually not be noticeable to users. For example, some of the
general site statistics on your homepage may take longer to update.
This will not be noticeable if your social network is already large and
populated with a lot of data"
